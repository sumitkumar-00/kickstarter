### Project Overview

My purpose of this project was to do exploratory analysis of Kickstarter dataset to answer some questions about this crowdfunding platform
 1. How popular is Kickstarter? How many projects funding campaigns are lauched on average in a month?
 2. What percentage of campaigns are successful?
 3. What are different categories of projects? Is Technology the dominant category?
 4. What makes a campaign successful? Is it the category, goal amount, duration, month or week of launch date etc.?
 5. What are some of the most successful campaigns?
 
### File Descriptions

There is only one file in this project that has the python code to help answer above mentioned questions.
