### Installation <a name='Installation'></a>

This project makes use of pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn and datetime packages. All of these are available in Anaconda distribution of Python. This code should execute successfully using Python version 3.*

### Project Overview <a name='Project-Overview'></a>

My purpose of this project was to do exploratory analysis of Kickstarter dataset to answer some questions about this crowdfunding platform
 1. How popular is Kickstarter? How many projects funding campaigns are lauched on average in a month?
 2. What percentage of campaigns are successful?
 3. What are different categories of projects? Is Technology the dominant category?
 4. What makes a campaign successful? Is it the category, goal amount, duration, month or week of launch date etc.?
 5. What are some of the most successful campaigns?
